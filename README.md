## Disclaimer - Can I use the Trackmania.io API for my own project?
*(Copied from Miss' ([@codecat](https://github.com/codecat)) Disclaimer)*

It depends. My usual answer is "yes, BUT.." before you start using the internal Trackmania.io API, read all of the following disclaimers:

- The API is unsupported. If I remove/change something, I will (likely) not give notice of it, and you'll have to deal with it yourself. (or wait for updates in this repo)

- The API is undocumented. You're on your own to figure out how the API works and what you need from it.

- Use a proper user agent header so that I can see how you're using the API. **(This one is `node-trackmania.io by GreepTheSheep (Greep#3022) - https://github.com/GreepTheSheep/node-trackmania.io`)**

- There are no hard limitations in place, so please be respectful of my server resources as well as Nadeo's. Cache stuff! Please let me know if you're planning to do any kind of "bulk" requests!

- Let me know what you're working on! I'm always curious and it lets me understand how people are using the API and who to contact about certain things if any contact is needed.

If you're still unsure about your use of the API, feel free to DM Miss#8888 with any further questions.
