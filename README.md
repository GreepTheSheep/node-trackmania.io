## Disclaimer - [Can I use the Trackmania.io API for my own project?](https://openplanet.nl/tmio/api)

[Please read this topic](https://openplanet.nl/tmio/api)

*The User Agent Header will be automatically set to your project directory name, with your current file name included, you can also set your User Agent with the method `Client.setUserAgent("My Project Name");`*

API Keys can be set with the method `Client.setAPIKey("yourname:yourkey");`

**You are responsible for the program you code, if you are banned from the API don't blame the wrapper or trackmania.io, blame yourself!**

If you're still unsure about your use of the API, feel free to DM Miss#8888 with any further questions.
